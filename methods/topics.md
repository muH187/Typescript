charAt(index): Returns the character at the specified index within a string.

concat(...strings): Combines two or more strings and returns a new string.

indexOf(searchValue[, fromIndex]): Returns the index within the calling string of the first occurrence of the specified value, starting the search at fromIndex. Returns -1 if the value is not found.

lastIndexOf(searchValue[, fromIndex]): Returns the index within the calling string object of the last occurrence of the specified value, searching backwards from fromIndex. Returns -1 if the value is not found.

slice(start[, end]): Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string.
split(separator[, limit]): Splits a string into an array of substrings based on the specified separator.

substr(start[, length]): Returns the characters in a string beginning at the specified location through the specified number of characters.

substring(start[, end]): Returns the characters in a string between two indexes into the string.
toLowerCase(): Converts all characters in a string to lowercase.

toUpperCase(): Converts all characters in a string to uppercase.

trim(): Removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

startsWith(searchString[, position]): Determines whether a string begins with the characters of a specified string.

endsWith(searchString[, length]): Determines whether a string ends with the characters of a specified string.

<!-- Array Methods -->

push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns that element, shifting all subsequent elements to a lower index.

unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
splice(): Adds or removes elements from an array at a specified index.

slice(): Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.

concat(): Joins two or more arrays and returns a new array.

indexOf(): Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

forEach(): Executes a provided function once for each array element.

map(): Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

filter(): Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

reduce(): Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

every(): Tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.

some(): Tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.
